CS 4760 Assignment 4 – Process Scheduling Simulator
Author: Lucas Lovellette

------------------------------------------------------------

Description

This project simulates a queue-based scheduler using a multi-level feedback queue system. The master process (oss) forks up to 18 concurrent user processes and schedules them based on a simulated system clock. It uses shared memory and message queues for interprocess communication and coordination.

Only oss advances the logical clock, and it determines when to fork new processes, dispatch processes from queues, and process blocked events.

------------------------------------------------------------

Build Instructions

Ensure you’re using a Linux environment (e.g., Delmar server or Ubuntu):

    make

This will compile two executables:
- oss — the master process
- user — the user process

------------------------------------------------------------

Running the Program

Simply run:

    ./oss

There are no command-line arguments. Output will be saved to log.txt.

The simulation will:
- Stop forking after 100 total children or after 3 real-time seconds
- End once all processes have finished
- Print statistics and logs to log.txt

------------------------------------------------------------

Logging Format

Every 0.5 simulated seconds, oss logs:
- The state of all queues (Q0, Q1, Q2, and Blocked)
- The process table

Other events include:
- Process creation
- Dispatches
- Full quantum usage
- Blocking and unblocking
- Terminations

Logging is capped at 10,000 lines.

------------------------------------------------------------

Statistics (printed at termination)

- Total CPU idle time
- Number of times each queue was used (Q0, Q1, Q2)
- Number of times processes were blocked

------------------------------------------------------------

Cleanup

Shared memory and message queues are automatically cleaned on normal or forced termination (Ctrl+C).

If needed, manually check with:

    ipcs -m
    ipcs -q

Remove manually with:

    ipcrm -m <shmid>
    ipcrm -q <msqid>
